        The United States Empire claims to be the world's champion of free
        speech. If it truly was, it would pardon Julian Assange, whom it has
        charged with the 'crime' of journalism.

        The United Kingdom - America's basic bitch - should never have tortured
        Julian Assange, isolating him from his spouse and children.
