        The United States Empire claims to be the world's champion of free
        speech and democracy. If that were true, it would pardon Julian Assange,
        whom it has convicted of the 'crime' of journalism.

        The United Kingdom - America's basic bitch - should never have tortured
        Julian Assange; isolating him from his spouse and children. It owes
        incalculable damages.
